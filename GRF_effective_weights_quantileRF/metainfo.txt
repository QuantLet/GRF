Name of Quantlet: GRF_effective_weights_quantileRF

Published in: 'GRF'

Description: 'Estimation of effective weights alpha_i(x) for the infeasable observations theta_tilde. The effective weights are computed by a quantile random forest on n=500, 1000, 2000 observations of uniform distributed data x_i ~U[-1,1] and target variable Y_i=theta(x_i) + eps_i, for a given theta function, here polynomial theta(x) = x + 4x^3, with Gaussian noise eps_i with mean zero and standard deviation of 1.'

Keywords: 'RF, GRF, quantile RF, infeasable function, estimation, effective weights, bandwidth'
